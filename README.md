# Site Design Considerations

### Client Expectations

The basic functions requested by the client were:
- Picture examples of the kinds of practices offered
- A simple meditation demonstration to give potential clients some information to take away from the site which could be built upon should they wish to join
- Convey a message of offering a way to deliver a more balanced, tranquil and mindful way of life through the practices and meditation techniques on available
- Links to all social media channels, as currently most clients are directed to the business from these
- Contact page where clients can get in touch with the company for further information

The client would like to have the ability to add further functionality at a later point to include a class timetable for yoga classes, an online booking form for yoga classes and a dedicated retreat page to showcase past retreat events. 

The client would like the website to convey a welcoming, serene and tranquil tone, focusing on using cool pink and grey based hues.

### User Expectations
- User to be able to quickly and easily understand to purpose of the site
- User to be able to find simple navigation around the website
- User to be able to locate business contact details
- User to be able to locate business social media links
- User to be able to contact the business without leaving the site and using an external source
- User to be able to view the site across an array of devices without loss of functionality
- A user with disabilities will be able to navigate the site freely without obstruction

## Colour Scheme and Font

[My Color Space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D9BDB2&sub=1) was used to choose a complimentary colour pallet based on the images selected. The aim was to ensure the best use of contrasting colours inline with accessibility guidelines.  
The colours used were:
- #D9BDB2 background colour for site header and footer
- #FFE9E5 background colour for site paragraph text and images

The initial heading font chosen was [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?query=danc). However upon testing the font was not that clear to read and did not make enough of an impact for a logo text.
Instead, [Amatic SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC?query=amatic) was picked as this provided a bolder look while still in keeping with the overall vision of the site. Of the fonts suggested by Google Fonts for appropriate pairings, [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open) was chosen for the paragraph text. It is a clean legible font, which sits nicely of the page alongside the heading text. Sans-serif was added as a backup option for those browsers that do not support some of the modern typefaces.  

## Site Skeleton

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format.
