# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.

Most people are familar with the basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but not everyone has heard of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. This version of the game orginated from the TV show, Big Bang Theory. This game adds 2 extra options, Lizard and Spock. The addition of these options changes the dynamic of the game providing the player with more variety and oportunity to win (and lose).

This project uses the programming languages of HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

# Site Design Considerations



### User Expectations
- The game should be engaging for the player and clearly display a winner and a loser
- The user interface should be easy to navigate
- There should be rules of how to play the game if the player has not played the game before
- The game should be resposive across a number of different media devices
- There should be the ability to contact the creator of the game
- There should be social media links to the game creators other games

## Colour Scheme and Font

[My Color Space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D9BDB2&sub=1) was used to choose a complimentary colour pallet based on the images selected. The aim was to ensure the best use of contrasting colours inline with accessibility guidelines.  
The colours used were:
- #D9BDB2 background colour for site header and footer
- #FFE9E5 background colour for site paragraph text and images

The initial heading font chosen was [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?query=danc). However upon testing the font was not that clear to read and did not make enough of an impact for a logo text.
Instead, [Amatic SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC?query=amatic) was picked as this provided a bolder look while still in keeping with the overall vision of the site. Of the fonts suggested by Google Fonts for appropriate pairings, [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open) was chosen for the paragraph text. It is a clean legible font, which sits nicely of the page alongside the heading text. Sans-serif was added as a backup option for those browsers that do not support some of the modern typefaces.  

## Site Skeleton

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format.
